# Thanks for checking out hexGrid.

## This project is meant to help designers build hexagonal grid layouts easily and seamlessly.

- Check out the live version here: http://azitowolf.github.io/hexGrid/dist/

- It uses javascript to render a grid layout based on certain specifications - lots of geometry fun.
- It's still in construction and is not super customizeable yet - but it's getting there!
- Fork me and contribute !
