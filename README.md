# Thanks for checking out hexGrid.

### This project is meant to help designers build hexagonal grid layouts easily and seamlessly.

## checkout the live version here: http://azitowolf.github.io/hexGrid/dist/

### it's still in construction and is not super customizeable yet - but it's getting there!
### fork me and contribute !
